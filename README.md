Mac Media Plugin for Touch Portal
Currently only playPause key works. unsure if i will add more later or not. i just wanted this specific key.


# AFTER YOU IMPORT THE PLUGIN YOU HAVE TO OPEN TERMINAL AND NAVIGATE TO THE ~/Documents/TouchPortal/plugins/MacMediaPlugin folder and run "chmod +x macmediaplugin" AND THEN RESTART THE PLUGIN IN TOUCH PORTAL FOR IT TO WORK. 

  - unsure of a way around it currently as i just made this while being bored lol. might look into it later and may add more functionality for outher special keys on function row. 
  - also only test on a mac mini m2, if it does not work for intel macs let me know here or in the touch portal discord and i can try to build for intel and see what happens. Also, i use a third party keyboard where my play/p[ause button is on key F8. unsure if this will still work with other macbooks or apples keyboards, in theory it should since it is not using the keyboard, but i have not tested anything.
